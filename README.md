# Diwali_Sales_Data_Analysis_Using_Python
I completed a data analysis project focused on Diwali sales using Python and popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.<br> This project aimed to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance during the Diwali festival season, enabling data-driven decision-making for business improvement.
